Data preprocessing and FeatureEngineering Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning modelling. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features from the dataset.

 Dataset

Source: The dataset is sourced from the Titanic competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
Features: Includes `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.
Target Variable: `Survived` (1 if the passenger survived, 0 otherwise).

Steps in the Project:

 1. Data Inspection

Basic Information: Displays the number of samples and features, and provides an overview of the dataset.
Target Variable Distribution: Analyses the distribution of the `Survived` column to understand the balance between classes.
Summary Statistics: Provides statistical summaries for numerical features.
Missing Values: Identifies columns with missing values.

 2. Data Preprocessing

Handle Missing Values: Fills missing values in the `Age` column with the median value.
Feature Scaling: Scales numerical features like `Age` and `Fare` to standardize them.
Handle Categorical Features: Encodes categorical features such as `Pclass` into numerical values.

 3. Feature Engineering

Family Size: Creates a new feature `Family Size` by summing `SibSp` and `Parch`, plus one.
Title Extraction: Extracts titles (e.g., Mr, Mrs) from the `Name` column and encodes them.

 4. Handling Imbalanced Data

Class Imbalance Check: Examines the distribution of the `Survived` classes and checks for imbalance.
SMOTE: Applies the SMOTE technique to oversample the minority class if a significant imbalance is detected.

 5. Data Transformation

Save Pre-processed Data: Saves the cleaned and transformed dataset as `preprocessed_titanic_data.csv`.

 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in building effective machine learning models. Proper handling of missing values, feature scaling, and class imbalance are crucial for model performance.
