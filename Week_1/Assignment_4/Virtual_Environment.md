concept of a virtual environment in Python:

A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. It ensures that dependencies required for one project do not interfere with those of another.

Importance in Data Science Projects:

1.Dependency Management: Different projects may require different versions of the same library. Virtual environments help manage these dependencies.

2.Reproducibility: Ensures that the project environment can be replicated on other machines, which is crucial for collaboration and deployment.

3.Isolation: Prevents conflicts between packages and libraries used in different projects.

Create a virtual environment:

1. python -m venv ml_env

2. ml_env\Scripts\activate

3. pip install numpy
